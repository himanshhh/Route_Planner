## Project Overview

This project is a Python-based route planning application utilizing Neo4j graph database technology to model and query the Indian Railways network. It provides users with functionalities such as loading train data into the graph database, exploring station statistics, and computing the shortest route between any two stations. The project demonstrates the power of graph databases for route optimization and network analysis in transport systems.

## Dataset

- **Dataset:** `trains.csv` â€” Indian Railways train routes  
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Indian Trains Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dnyaneshyeole/indian-trains?select=trains.csv)  
- **Key Variables:**

  | Variable       | Description                         |
  |----------------|-----------------------------------|
  | train_name     | Name or ID of the train            |
  | train_number   | Unique train number                 |
  | source        | Origin station                     |
  | destination   | Final station                     |
  | distance      | Distance covered (in km)           |
  | total_time    | Duration of journey                 |
  | departure     | Departure time                     |
  | arrival       | Arrival time                       |

## Files and Functionality

- **`data_load.py`**  
  Loads train route data from the CSV file into the Neo4j graph database.

- **`statistics.py`**  
  Provides key statistics of the database, including the total number of stations and routes (nodes and relationships), top 5 busiest stations by outgoing routes, and visualizes these busiest stations.

- **`planner.py`**  
  Implements the route planner functionality. Users specify origin and destination stations, and it calculates the shortest route using graph algorithms. The output is both printed in the command line and saved as an HTML file (`route_result.html`). The route is also visualized for better comprehension.
